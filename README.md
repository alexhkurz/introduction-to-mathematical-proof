(... under construction ... still early stages ...)

The outlines of a course for students of the last two years of high school or beginning university students who want to learn more about mathematical proofs.

[Introduction](introduction.md): Why do we need proofs in mathematics?

## Part I: Examples

All these examples can be presented in a way that they are accessible to students in the last year of high school or first year university. 

While most students will be from maths and computer science, the aim is to address a general audience. 

There are plenty of opportunities with the examples below to make detours through the history of mathematics. I would also be interested to make this more of a focus.

Geometry: 
- L1.1: The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. A proof and a non-proof.
*Homework:* find the mistake in this proof of [90=100](https://cnx.org/contents/OD1Lhy17@20.20:5gTEWfDM@8/90-100-A-Proof).

Number Theory: 
- L1.2: Infinity: There are infinitely many primes. 
- L1.3: Proof by algorithm: Existence of a greatest common devisor. 

Algebra: 
- L2.1: Some non proofs based on common fallacies such as squaring not being injective and division by zero.
 *Homework:* Find the mistakes in some selected non proofs.
- L2.2: The square root of 2 is not rational.
*Homework:* Generalise this proof to square roots of arbitrary natural numbers. Generalise this proof to other roots.
- L2.3: Some things that my look contradictory, maybe are not: we can take the square root of -1 and we can have numbers where 1+1=0.

Calculus: 
- L3.1-3.3:There are plenty of paradoxa in calculus such as infinite sequences of converging against two different values, or infinitesimals that are larger than zero but small than all real numbers. 
- This is the pivotal section of the course. The difficulties of calculus gave birth to set theory and logic. Moreover, it is a great example of how we need proofs as a method to even answer a basic question such as "what is the number line?".

Set theory: 
- L4.1: The rationals are enumberable ... 
- L4.2: ... but the real numbers are not. 

Logic:
- L4.3: The set that of all sets that do not contain themselves. 

Computability: 

- L5.1: The halting problem is not computable.
