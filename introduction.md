# Introduction: Why do we need proof in mathematics?

The two most powerful and robust sciences are maths and physics. Physics and Maths may be the only sciences, in which the scientific consensus about the most important theories is 100%.

It is worth reflecting about why this is the case.

Physics cultivates a balance between theory and experiment. Nobel prizes are divided equally between theoretical physicists and experimental phsycicist. The generally accepted physical theories stand out because 

- they are causal theories that allow us to make precise predictions,
- there is not a single known experiment contradicting them.

An interesting story illustrating the power of physical theories is the [faster than light neutrino anomality](Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly). In 2011, experiments observed neutrinos  travling faster than light. Despite big efforts, for a long time no mistakes in the experiment could be found. Nevertheless, physicists where reluctant to believe the experiment because it contradicted Einstein's relativity. The details of this story can be found in the article [OPERA: What Went Wrong](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/neutrinos/neutrinos-faster-than-light/opera-what-went-wrong/), which is very much worth reading.

Of course, I am not saying that physicists can just invent theories as they wish. On the contrary, the physical theories accepted by the scientific consensus are known to be true in the sense that they are known to not be in contradictions with any experiment on the record ever made. 

Physical theories are constrained by experiments. 

So what does constrain mathematical theories?

Certainly not experiments. In the real world, there are no mathematical objects. In the real world there are no triangles. Only approximate triangles. But mathematical theorems hold for triangles, not for the approximate triangles of the real world.

Moreover, since the objects of mathematics are ideas, in mathematics as in arts, music and literature one is guided by creativity, adventure and beauty. But then, what makes maths different?

In mathematics your imagination has no limits as long as you do not build maths that leads to a contradiction, to an absurd conclusion. 

But how can we make sure that we are not making mental constructions that are impossible? 

By mathemtical proof.

So far we described an analogy between the role of experiment in physics and proof in mathematics: Both constrain what theories we are allowed to build.

But the analogy does go deeper.

On the physics side, the power of physical theories is not only due to experiments. The power of physical theories also relies on mathematical proof. For example, from some simple assumptions, including that  the speed of light is the same in all reference systems, one can prove the famous equation $E=m\cdot c^2$.

So even before we have done any experiment on $E=m\cdot c^2$, it is safe to assume that the equation is true. This gave engineers the confidence that an atomic bomb can be built, even though nobody has ever done this before. (Maybe better to find a less controversial example? Or just more examples?)

On the mathematical side, mathematicians use proofs instead of experimental verification. Theorems that have proofs cannot lead to contradictory conclusions. (This general statement needs some qualifications we may explore later.)

But apart from establishing truth, proofs are also important in a more pragmatic way.

Suppose you create a new mathemtical definition. How do you convince your fellow mathematicians that it is an interesting definition? An interesting definition should allow us to prove many results, preferably surprising ones, from a small number of assumptions.

Of course, there are many other reasons why proofs are important. We will see examples of all of the following.

- Surprising results we just would not believe without proof.

- Some of the most celebrated results in maths are proofs that something is not possible.

- The search for proofs forces us to find new ideas.

- Once we worked hard to find one proof, we often get a large number of other proofs very quickly.

- The proof is often more consequential than the theorem.

- A new proof generates new questions. These new questions are often more consequential than the proof.

- Mathematics is about patterns and proofs are a way to generate more patterns. Some of the most powerful patterns in maths arise from analogies between proofs.

- As we build up, mathematics gets more and more sophisticated and more and more care is needed not to get yourself into contradictions.

- Mathematicians use existing theorems as building blocks for future mathematics. If these theorems are not reliable the whole beautiful tower of maths breaks down.

- Not all areas of mathematics are easily accessible to intuition. But intuition is necessary to make progress. Mathematicians use proofs to build up an intuitive understanding of new areas of maths that seem abstract at the outset and become familiar through proof on the way. 

- Proofs is the vehicle mathematicians use to travel the landsacpe of ideas.
